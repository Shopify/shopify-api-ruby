This library provides support for Ruby [Shopify apps](https://apps.shopify.com/) to access the [Shopify Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin), by making it easier to perform the following actions:

- Creating [online](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/access-modes#online-access) or [offline](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/access-modes#offline-access) access tokens for the Admin API via OAuth
- Making requests to the [REST API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest)
- Making requests to the [GraphQL API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql)
- Registering/processing webhooks

In addition to the Admin API, this library also allows querying the [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront).

You can use this library in any application that has a Ruby backend, since it doesn't rely on any specific framework â€” you can include it alongside your preferred stack and use the features that you need to build your app.

**Note**: These instructions apply to v10 or later of this package. If you're running v9 in your app, you can find the documentation [in this branch](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/tree/v9).

## Use with Rails
If using in the Rails framework, we highly recommend you use the [shopify_app](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app) gem to interact with this gem. Authentication, session storage, webhook registration, and other frequently implemented paths are managed in that gem with easy to use configurations.

## Requirements

To follow these usage guides, you will need to:

- have a working knowledge of ruby and a web framework such as Rails or Sinatra
- have a Shopify Partner account and development store
- have an app already set up in your test store or partner account
- add the URL and the appropriate redirect for your OAuth callback route to your app settings

## Installation

Add the following to your Gemfile:

```sh
gem "shopify_api"
```

or use [bundler](https://bundler.io):

```sh
bundle add shopify_api
```

## Steps to use the Gem

### Setup Shopify Context

Start by initializing the `ShopifyAPI::Context` with the parameters of your app by calling `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup` (example below) when your app starts (e.g `application.rb` in a Rails app).

```ruby
ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(
  api_key: "<api-key>",
  api_secret_key: "<api-secret-key>",
  host: "<https://application-host-name.com>",
  scope: "read_orders,read_products,etc",
  is_embedded: true, # Set to true if you are building an embedded app
  api_version: "2022-01", # The version of the API you would like to use
  is_private: false, # Set to true if you have an existing private app
)
```

### Performing OAuth

You need to go through OAuth as described [here](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth) to create sessions for shops using your app.
The Shopify API gem tries to make this easy by providing functions to begin and complete the OAuth process. See the [Oauth doc](docs/usage/oauth.md) for instructions on how to use these.

### Register Webhooks and a Webhook Handler

If you intend to use webhooks in your application follow the steps in the [Webhooks doc](docs/usage/webhooks.md) for instructions on registering and handling webhooks.

### Start Making Authenticated Shopify API Requests

Once your app can perform OAuth, it can now make authenticated Shopify API calls, see docs for:
* Making [Admin REST API](docs/usage/rest.md) requests
* Making [Admin GraphQL API](docs/usage/graphql.md) requests
* Making [Storefront GraphQL API](docs/usage/graphql_storefront.md) requests
