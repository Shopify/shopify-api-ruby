# = \Hash With Indifferent Access
#
# Implements a hash where keys <tt>:foo</tt> and <tt>"foo"</tt> are considered
# to be the same.
#
#   rgb = ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess.new
#
#   rgb[:black] = '#000000'
#   rgb[:black]  # => '#000000'
#   rgb['black'] # => '#000000'
#
#   rgb['white'] = '#FFFFFF'
#   rgb[:white]  # => '#FFFFFF'
#   rgb['white'] # => '#FFFFFF'
#
# Internally symbols are mapped to strings when used as keys in the entire
# writing interface (calling <tt>[]=</tt>, <tt>merge</tt>, etc). This
# mapping belongs to the public interface. For example, given:
#
#   hash = ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess.new(a: 1)
#
# You are guaranteed that the key is returned as a string:
#
#   hash.keys # => ["a"]
#
# Technically other types of keys are accepted:
#
#   hash = ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess.new(a: 1)
#   hash[0] = 0
#   hash # => {"a"=>1, 0=>0}
#
# but this class is intended for use cases where strings or symbols are the
# expected keys and it is convenient to understand both as the same. For
# example the +params+ hash in Ruby on \Rails.
#
# Note that core extensions define <tt>Hash#with_indifferent_access</tt>:
#
#   rgb = { black: '#000000', white: '#FFFFFF' }.with_indifferent_access
#
# which may be handy.
#
# To access this class outside of \Rails, require the core extension with:
#
#   require "active_support/core_ext/hash/indifferent_access"
#
# which will, in turn, require this file.

  # and "ö" to "ue" and "oe", or to add support for transliterating Russian
  # to ASCII.

  #         ü: "ue"

  #     transliterate: {
  #       rule: {
  #         'ü' => 'ue',
  #         'ö' => 'oe'
  #       }
  #     }
  #   })
  #
  # The value for <tt>i18n.transliterate.rule</tt> can be a simple Hash that
  # maps characters to ASCII approximations as shown above, or, for more
  # complex requirements, a Proc:
  #
  #   I18n.backend.store_translations(:de, i18n: {
  #     transliterate: {
  #       rule: ->(string) { MyTransliterator.transliterate(string) }

# = Lazy Load Hooks
#
# LazyLoadHooks allows \Rails to lazily load a lot of components and thus
# making the app boot faster. Because of this feature now there is no need to
# require +ActiveRecord::Base+ at boot time purely to apply
# configuration. Instead a hook is registered that applies configuration once
# +ActiveRecord::Base+ is loaded. Here +ActiveRecord::Base+ is
# used as example but this feature can be applied elsewhere too.
#
# Here is an example where on_load method is called to register a hook.
#
#   initializer 'active_record.initialize_timezone' do
#     ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) do
#       self.time_zone_aware_attributes = true
#       self.default_timezone = :utc
#     end
#   end
#
# When the entirety of +ActiveRecord::Base+ has been
# evaluated then run_load_hooks is invoked. The very last line of
# +ActiveRecord::Base+ is:
#
#   ActiveSupport.run_load_hooks(:active_record, ActiveRecord::Base)
#
# run_load_hooks will then execute all the hooks that were registered
# with the on_load method. In the case of the above example, it will
# execute the block of code that is in the +initializer+.
#
# Registering a hook that has already run results in that hook executing
# immediately. This allows hooks to be nested for code that relies on
# multiple lazily loaded components:
#
#   initializer "action_text.renderer" do
#     ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_controller_base) do
#       ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_text_content) do
#         self.default_renderer = Class.new(ActionController::Base).renderer

# = Active Support \Time Zone
#
# The TimeZone class serves as a wrapper around +TZInfo::Timezone+ instances.
# It allows us to do the following:
#
# * Limit the set of zones provided by TZInfo to a meaningful subset of 134
#   zones.
# * Retrieve and display zones with a friendlier name
#   (e.g., "Eastern Time (US & Canada)" instead of "America/New_York").
# * Lazily load +TZInfo::Timezone+ instances only when they're needed.
# * Create ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instances via TimeZone's +local+,
#   +parse+, +at+, and +now+ methods.
#
# If you set <tt>config.time_zone</tt> in the \Rails Application, you can

  # Provides a +delegate+ class method to easily expose contained objects'
  # public methods as your own.
  #
  # ==== Options
  # * <tt>:to</tt> - Specifies the target object name as a symbol or string
  # * <tt>:prefix</tt> - Prefixes the new method with the target name or a custom prefix
  # * <tt>:allow_nil</tt> - If set to true, prevents a +Module::DelegationError+
  #   from being raised
  # * <tt>:private</tt> - If set to true, changes method visibility to private
  #
  # The macro receives one or more method names (specified as symbols or
  # strings) and the name of the target object via the <tt>:to</tt> option
  # (also a symbol or string).
  #
  # Delegation is particularly useful with Active Record associations:
  #
  #   class Greeter < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     def hello
  #       'hello'
  #     end
  #
  #     def goodbye

  #
  #   Foo.new.hello   # => "hello"
  #   Foo.new.goodbye # => NoMethodError: undefined method `goodbye' for #<Foo:0x1af30c>
  #
  # Multiple delegates to the same target are allowed:
  #
  #   class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     belongs_to :greeter
  #     delegate :hello, :goodbye, to: :greeter
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.goodbye # => "goodbye"
  #
  # Methods can be delegated to instance variables, class variables, or constants
  # by providing them as a symbols:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     CONSTANT_ARRAY = [0,1,2,3]
  #     @@class_array  = [4,5,6,7]
  #
  #     def initialize
  #       @instance_array = [8,9,10,11]
  #     end
  #     delegate :sum, to: :CONSTANT_ARRAY
  #     delegate :min, to: :@@class_array
  #     delegate :max, to: :@instance_array
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.sum # => 6
  #   Foo.new.min # => 4
  #   Foo.new.max # => 11
  #
  # It's also possible to delegate a method to the class by using +:class+:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     def self.hello
  #       "world"
  #     end
  #
  #     delegate :hello, to: :class
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.hello # => "world"
  #
  # Delegates can optionally be prefixed using the <tt>:prefix</tt> option. If the value
  # is <tt>true</tt>, the delegate methods are prefixed with the name of the object being
  # delegated to.
  #
  #   Person = Struct.new(:name, :address)
  #
  #   class Invoice < Struct.new(:client)
  #     delegate :name, :address, to: :client, prefix: true

  #   invoice = Invoice.new(john_doe)
  #   invoice.client_name    # => "John Doe"
  #   invoice.client_address # => "Vimmersvej 13"

  # It is also possible to supply a custom prefix.

  #
  #   invoice = Invoice.new(john_doe)
  #   invoice.customer_name    # => 'John Doe'
  #   invoice.customer_address # => 'Vimmersvej 13'

# Most objects are cloneable, but not all. For example you can't dup methods:
#
#   method(:puts).dup # => TypeError: allocator undefined for Method
#
# Classes may signal their instances are not duplicable removing +dup+/+clone+
# or raising exceptions from them. So, to dup an arbitrary object you normally
# use an optimistic approach and are ready to catch an exception, say:
#
#   arbitrary_object.dup rescue object
#
# Rails dups objects in a few critical spots where they are not that arbitrary.
# That rescue is very expensive (like 40 times slower than a predicate), and it
# is often triggered.
#
# That's why we hardcode the following cases and check duplicable? instead of

  #
  # == Method chaining

  # method chaining on the result of any of these methods.

  # String and Char work like expected. The bang! methods change the internal string representation in the Chars
  # object. Interoperability problems can be resolved easily with a +to_s+ call.
