title: A new release of the Shopify API is due soon

This is an automated reminder for the maintainers that a new Stable release of the Shopify API is due soon, so the library needs to be updated.

A new library release should be prepared to:
* add the upcoming Stable release
* remove the oldest Stable release which will no longer be supported.

The PR should be created as a **draft** but not yet be merged.

The release schedule can be found at https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/versioning

Review the changelog and consider if anything in the library needs to change:

Test against the upcoming release by using the Release Candidate.

Another reminder issue will be created on the date of the next release.
When that happens, test again using the now Stable API version, and aim to release an update of the library within one week.

Thank you!
