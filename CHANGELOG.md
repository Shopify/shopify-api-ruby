## Version 9.5.1

- [#891](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/891) Removed the upper bound on the `activeresource` dependency to allow apps to use the latest version

## Version 9.5

- [#883](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/883) Add support for Ruby 3.0

## Version 9.4.1

- [#847](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/847) Update `create_permission_url` method to use grant_options
- [#852](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/852) Bumping kramdown to fix a security vulnerability

## Version 9.4.0

- [#843](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/843) Introduce a new `access_scopes` attribute on the Session class.
  - Specifying this in the Session constructor is optional. By default, this attribute returns `nil`.

## Version 9.3.0

- [#797](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/797) Release new Endpoint `fulfillment_order.open` and `fulfillment_order.reschedule`.

- [#818](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/818) Avoid depending on ActiveSupport in Sesssion class.

- Freeze all string literals. This should have no impact unless your application is modifying ('monkeypatching') the internals of the library in an unusual way.

- [#802](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/802) Made `inventory_quantity` a read-only field in Variant

- [#821](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/821) Add logging based on environment variable, move log subscriber out of `detailed_log_subscriber`.
  The `ActiveResource::DetailedLogSubscriber` no longer automatically attaches when the class is loaded. If you were previously relying on that behaviour, you'll now need to call `ActiveResource::DetailedLogSubscriber.attach_to(:active_resource_detailed)`. (If using the new `SHOPIFY_LOG_PATH` environment setting then this is handled for you).

- Provide `ApiAccess` value object to encapsulate scope operations [#829](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/829)

## Version 9.2.0

- Contains [#708](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/708) which is a revert for [#655](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/pull/655) due to the deprecated inventory parameters not being removed correctly in some cases

## Version 9.0.3

- We now raise a `ShopifyAPI::ValidationException` exception when clients try to use `Product` and `Variant` with deprecated inventory-related fields in API version `2019-10` or later.
