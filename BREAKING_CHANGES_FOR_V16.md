# Breaking change notice for version 16.0.0

## Minimum Ruby Version Requirement

The minimum required Ruby version has been updated from 3.0 to 3.2.

### Why this change?

Ruby 3.0  and 3.1 have reached End of Life (EOL).

### Migration Guide

If you're currently using Ruby 3.0 or 3.1, you'll need to upgrade to Ruby 3.2 or higher before upgrading to shopify-api-ruby v16.0.0.

**Note:** Ruby 3.2+ includes performance improvements and new features. Most applications should not require code changes beyond updating the Ruby version itself.
